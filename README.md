# AI_Interview_Simulator

An **AI-powered Interview Simulator** that helps users practice for technical interviews by combining **Generative AI** and **OpenCV** technologies.

This simulator not only asks relevant coding or domain-based questions using generative models, but also analyzes your answers and monitors your **facial presence**, **eye openness**, and **motion**â€”just like in real interview settings.
